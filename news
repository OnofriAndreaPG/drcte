## Changes in 'drcte'

2022-06-16: Functions from package 'kedd' have been included in 'drcte', to remove the dependency on 'keed', that is no longer available at CRAN for R 4.2.0 (vers. 1.0.10)
2022-07-04: A bug has been corrected, that, in some instances, scrambled the namings of curveid levels with KDE and NPMLE fits (vers. 1.0.11)
